##  Student Management System (C++)

The Student Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows the management of student information in a simple and structured way.

The system enables users to store student details such as name and module, enter academic grades (TD, TP, and Exam), and automatically calculate the final grade using weighted coefficients. Based on the final result, the application determines whether the student has passed or failed.

This project was designed to apply fundamental C++ programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, classes and objects, functions, loops, arrays, and basic data structures. It follows a layered architecture that separates user interaction, business logic, and data representation, making the code clear, modular, and easy to maintain.

The Student Management System is suitable for academic use and can be extended in the future to include file management, databases, or a graphical user interface.
